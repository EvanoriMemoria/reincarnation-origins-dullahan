# Dullahan

The Dullahan is originally forked from Adapted Origins. I put heavier emphasis on the ability to summon your steed, with a much lower cooldown, and made a few quality of life tweaks like binding chain slowing hit enemies, occasionally getting lanterns back when consuming soul lanterns, and buffing the starting kit.

**Positive**
- Loose Bones: Chance to drop Bones when Damaged.
- Reaper's Requiem: Standing close to a soul campfire will channel souls into your body, satiating your hunger.
- Cower, Run: You have a terrifying presence. Nearby entities become afflicted with blindness and weakness.
- Binding Chain: You can impale a target with a barbed chain, slowing them and inflicting wither.
- Death's Arsenal: You start with items you gathered on your hunts as a rider of the night.
- The Pact Part 1: Your contract to hunt souls empowers you under the light of the moon.
- Nightmare Steed: You can summon your trusty steed whenever you desire.
- Spectre's Dismay: Shoot an explosive wither skull at your prey.


**Neutral**
- Soul Snare: You cannot artificially create soul lanterns. Instead, you will ensnare the souls of those you kill within a lantern you are carrying in your offhand.
-Soul Devourer: Food does not satiate your wretched form. Instead, the Dullahan feeds on the souls of their victims captured in soul lanterns.

**Negative**
- The Pact Part 2:  The second part of your contract stipulates; During the day you are slowed and your thirst for souls is insatiable.
- Cursed: Being attack with any weapon imbued with a curse of vanishing will banish you, ending your hunt.
- You are undead.
